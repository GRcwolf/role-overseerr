#+author: Chris Wolf <chris@chriswolf.ch>

This is a very simple role that installs overseerr with snap.

** Requirements
The targeted system must already have snap insalled.
Also the =community.general= collection has to be present.

** Configuration
Snap doesn't really provide any configuration options, therefore you can't customize anything.
